 * <p>
 * An immutable penta consisting of five {@code Object} elements.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although the implementation is immutable, there is no restriction on the
 * objects that may be stored. If mutable objects are stored in the penta, then
 * the penta itself effectively becomes mutable. The class is also
 * {@code final}, so a subclass can not add undesirable behaviour.
 * </p>
