 * An immutable quad consisting of four {@code Object} elements.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although the implementation is immutable, there is no restriction on the
 * objects that may be stored. If mutable objects are stored in the quad, then
 * the quad itself effectively becomes mutable. The class is also {@code final},
 * so a subclass can not add undesirable behaviour.

 *            the second element type
 * @param <C>
 *            the third element type
 * @param <D>
 *            the fourth element type
